### Supported Algorithm

- Insertion sort
- Merge sort

### Supported Data Structures

- Singly linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Queue
- Stack

### How It Works

install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

create day 1

```bash
./scripts/v1
```

this will progressively create folders named

```
src/day1
src/day2
...
```

`scripts/v1` will also update the `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config` to point
the latest `day` folder via tspaths. This allows us to avoid updating anything
for testing each day.

#### Testing

```
yarn test
```

I have yet to create a testing strategy for next sets of algorithms, but we
will get there when i cross that bridge.
